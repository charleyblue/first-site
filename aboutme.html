        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I am currently an electrician who is  in the process of a reinvention. I love both the hands-on aspect of being an electrician as well as the intellectual necessity of applied science, but it is time to give my body a break from the day-in-day-out wear and tear of climbing up and down ladders, crawling under houses and machinery, bending conduit, and pulling wires and cables. It is time to give my bones a rest!</p>
        <p>I have always had a keen interest in the aspects of creating pleasing designs and my first design exposure began way back while working as a landscaper. I began my adulthood career creating and building beautiful landscapes at homes and commercial sites and found it very rewarding. Again, between the  body and the economy, I said enough after 15 years of this worthy occupation and I found the study of applied physics required for competency in the electrical field a worthy alternative pursuit.</p>
        <p>This leads me to this current juncture, another 15 years later, with the development and perfection of my new passion of web design and development. A little less physically demanding but none the less, exciting.</p>

        <h1>More about Me</h1>
        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I was an active mountain biker until a recent knee injury put a stop to this activity. I hope to get back into a less stressful version soon and hope that the pain will give me a break now and then. I enjoyed the workout of climbing a trail and the rush of the descent. Staying on the trail and upright while navigating rocks, obstructions, and turns was an enjoyable aspect of this sport.</p>
        <h2>My Passion</h2>
        <p>I am a nerdy science layman who likes to read Scientific American articles, as well as all of the wonderful science themed links found on social media. On my Facebook page, I follow many science-centric pages and glance over many articles. This can lead to quite a time usurping past time but it is interesting to stay up on current scientific advances.</p>
        <h2>My Dream Job</h2>
        <p>Although I like working on independent projects, I also like being part of a team effort. I am an eager student as well as teacher. I love to share with an interested person the lessons and insights I have picked up in my work life. I enjoy researching things and think that the Internet is fantastic for its ease of information access.</p>
        <p>I want to take this passion and apply it to solving communications problems with web design. I would love to be part of a team and tasked to solve all kinds of these problems associated with presenting clear typography and graphic design to convey a message.</p>
